<h2>Behavior Driven Development Process (BDD)</h2>
<p>A table of specs that demonstrate what each behavior should look like in action:</p>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr id="specs">
    <th>Behaviour</th>
    <th>Input Example</th>
    <th>Output Example</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>The Program should handle:</th>
    <th>When it receives:</th>
    <th>It should return:</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a year that is NOT a Leap year</td>
    <td>1993</td>
    <td>false</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a year that is divisible by 4</td>
    <td>2004</td>
    <td>true</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a year that is divisible by 100</td>
    <td>1900</td>
    <td>false</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a year that is divisible by 400</td>
    <td>2000</td>
    <td>true</td>
  </tr>

<h3>How to follow-up with Behavior-Driven Development Process</h3>

<h4>1. Identify Specifications/Behaviors!</h4>
<p>Identify the behaviors your program should exhibit. Include example input and output that would demonstrate this behavior is working.</p>

<p>Make sure each behavior truly is a single behavior. In the leap year example, checking that the number is divisible by 400 and checking if the number is divisible by 4 are two separate ways to check for a leap year, and are therefore two separate behaviors, even though they both result in the program returning true.</p>

<h4>2. Code the Behaviors!</h4>
<p>Beginning with the simplest possible behavior, add the least amount of code to integrate this behavior into the application.</p>

<h4>3. Test!</h4>
<p>Write automated tests to check your code but knowing how to test manually is a good foundation. Enter the example input that corresponds to your first specification. Check to see if you receive the example output.</p>

<p>If not, it's evident that the behavior is not functioning as expected, and you'll need to revisit your code.</p>

<h4>4. Commit</h4>
<p>If you do receive the correct output, your spec passes! Each time a new test passes, you'll want to commit your work.</p>

<h4>5. Repeat!</h4>
<p>Repeat this same process for each specification. Begin with the simplest possible spec, and work your way up in complexity.</p>

<h4>Refactor!</h4>
<p>Whenever necessary, refactor between specifications. Just ensure your previously passing specs still pass after refactoring.</p>
